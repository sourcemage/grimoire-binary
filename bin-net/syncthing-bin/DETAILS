Syncthing is an application that lets you synchronize your files across
multiple devices. This means the creation, modification or deletion of files
on one machine will automatically be replicated to your other devices. We
believe your data is your data alone and you deserve to choose where it is
stored. Therefore Syncthing does not upload your data to the cloud but
exchanges your data across your machines as soon as they are online at the
same time.
