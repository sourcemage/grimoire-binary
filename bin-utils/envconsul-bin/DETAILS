cat << EOF
This is a binary version of Envconsul.

Envconsul provides a convenient way to launch a subprocess with environment
variables populated from HashiCorp Consul and Vault. The tool is inspired by
envdir and envchain, but works on many major operating systems with no runtime
requirements. It is also available via a Docker container for scheduled
environments.

Envconsul supports 12-factor applications which get their configuration via the
environment. Environment variables are dynamically populated from Consul or
Vault, but the application is unaware; applications just read environment
variables. This enables extreme flexibility and portability for applications
across systems.
