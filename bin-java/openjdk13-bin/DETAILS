OpenJDK (Open Java Development Kit) is a free and open-source implementation of
the Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE). It is the result of an effort
Sun Microsystems began in 2006. The implementation is licensed under the GNU
General Public License (GNU GPL) version 2 with a linking exception. Were
it not for the GPL linking exception, components that linked to the Java
class library would be subject to the terms of the GPL license. OpenJDK is
the official reference implementation of Java SE since version 7.
