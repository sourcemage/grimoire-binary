Boundary provides simple and secure access to hosts and services.

Traditional approaches like SSH bastion hosts or VPNs require distributing and
managing credentials, configuring network controls like firewalls, and
exposing the private network. Boundary provides a secure way to access hosts
and critical systems without having to manage credentials or expose your
network, and is entirely open source.

Boundary is designed to be straightforward to understand, highly scalable, and
resilient. It can run in clouds, on-prem, secure enclaves and more, and does
not require an agent to be installed on every end host.

Unlike firewalls, Boundary performs per-access authentication and
authorization checks, allowing for much higher level mappings of users to
services or hosts than at network layers. Although complementary to secrets
managers (like HashiCorp's own Vault), Boundary fills a different niche,
allowing the credential that is eventually used to be hidden entirely from the
user.
