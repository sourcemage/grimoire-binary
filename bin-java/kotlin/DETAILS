cat << EOF
Kotlin is a cross-platform, statically typed, general-purpose programming language with type inference.
It is designed to interoperate fully with Java, and the JVM version of its standard library
depends on the Java Class Library, but type inference allows its syntax to be more concise.
It also mainly targets the JVM, but also compiles to JavaScript or native code (via LLVM).
