           SHORT="firefox for obfuscated TCP"
cat << EOF
Obfuscated TCP is a transport layer protocol that adds opportunistic 
encryption. It's designed to hamper and detect large-scale wiretapping 
and corruption of TCP traffic on the Internet. 

The Firefox patch is a patch to the core source tree. I haven't been 
able to extract this as an extension yet because it's changing things 
very deep in the networking code and the extension system wasn't 
designed to support that level of modification.
